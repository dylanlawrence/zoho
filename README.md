# Zoho
Drupal 8 Module For CRM

The module is rewritten as per the updated zoho api implementation.

It provides simple api methods which can be called from other modules to store and fetch data from Zoho CRM.
i.e, the module provides generalised methods to store information like leads, contacts etc from drupal forms to Zoho CRM and vice versa.

Provides an admin interface for zoho api configurations where you can provide zoho authtoken directly or generate authtoken from the admin interface. Your Credentials are not stored.
